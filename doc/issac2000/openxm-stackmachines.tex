\section{OpenXM Stack machines}\label{sec:ox-stackmachines} (Tamura)

In OpenXM specification, all servers are stack machines.
These are called OpenXM stack machines.
When a server ox\_xyz gets an OX data message,
it translates the data into an object of its local mathematical system 
and push the object on the stack.
The translation scheme together with definitions of 
mathematical operations
of the system ox\_xyz is called the {\it PhraseBook} of
ox\_xyz following the OpenMath specification.

Any OX command message starts with the int32 tag OX\_COMMAND.
The body is OpenXM stack machine operation code expressed by int32.
The codes are listed below.
\begin{verbatim}
#define SM_popSerializedLocalObject               258

#define SM_control_to_debug_mode                 1025
#define SM_control_exit_debug_mode               1026
#define SM_control_reset_connection              1030
\end{verbatim}

OpenXM does not have a standard for mathematical operation sets
while it is a work in progress in \cite{gap}.
Each OpenXM server has its own mathematical operation set.
Mathematical operations are performed as follows.
Mathematical operator name, such as fctr (asir factorization command),
is pushed as a string,
the stack machine command
SM\_executeFunction (269) pops the operator name, the number of arguments
and arguments, and
the OX stack machine evaluates the operator, and pushes the result on the stack.
For example, the following code factorizes $x^{100}-1$ by calling
ox\_asir from asir.
\begin{verbatim}
P = ox_launch(); 
ox_push_cmo(P,x^100-1); ox_push_cmo(P,ox_int32(1));
ox_push_cmd(P,269); 
Ans = ox_pop_cmo(P);
\end{verbatim}

When an error has occurred on an OpenXM server,
an error object is pushed to the stack instead of a result of the computation.
The error object consists of the serial number of the OX message
which caused the error, and an error message.
\begin{verbatim}
[341] ox_rpc(0,"fctr",1.2*x)$
[342] ox_pop_cmo(0);
error([8,fctr : invalid argument])
\end{verbatim}

Errors are not sent to the client except a SM\_pop* command is received.
OX stackmachines works in the asynchronous mode which is similar 
to X servers.
For servers for graphic applications, it is an advantageous feature.
It is also easy to emulate RPC and a web server for MCP \cite{iamc} 
on our asynchronous OX stackmachines.
