\section{OpenXM Development Environment}  (Maekawa)

OpenXM package is now developed and maintained by
a CVS server on the FreeBSD operating system.
This is an open system to develop softwares.
Any mathematical programmers are welcome to
join with the committer team of OpenXM.
The CVS web is used for reading the source tree and the change logs.
The cvsup server is used to synchronize the local source tree with
the main source tree.
These software tools are widely used to develop free software packages
like FreeBSD operating system.
Many mathematical softwares are developed by one programmer
without using these tools.
We realized that these tools are very useful and powerful in developement
of the OpenXM mathematical software package by a team.
