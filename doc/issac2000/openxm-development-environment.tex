\section{OpenXM Development Environment}  

OpenXM package is currently developed and maintained on
a CVS server.
This is an open system to develop softwares.
Any mathematical programmer is welcome to
join with the committer team of OpenXM.
The CVS web is used for reading the source tree and the change logs.
The cvsup server is used to synchronize the local source tree with
the main source tree.
These software tools are used to develop free software packages
like the FreeBSD operating system.
These tools are very useful and powerful in developement
of the OpenXM mathematical software package by a team.
