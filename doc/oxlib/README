$OpenXM$

This directory contains samples on OpenXM/library mode interface.
For example, you can factor a given multivariable polynomial
over Q or algebraic numbers by linking libasir.a.
Details on the OpenXM/library mode interface is explained in
OpenXM/doc/OpenXM-specs/OpenXM-eg.dvi (in English) or
OpenXM/doc/OpenXM-specs/OpenXM-jp.dvi (in Japanese).

A sample session with test3:
  % ./test3
  Input>asir 123     <- push 123
  Input>pop          <- pop and print
  Output>
  00 00 00 14 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 7b
  Input>push 00 00 00 14 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0c  <- push 12
  Input>push 00 00 00 14 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 08  <- push 8
  Input>push 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 02              <- push int32 2
  Input>asir "igcd"   <- push a string (function name)
  Input>cmd 269       <- executeFunction
  Input>pop
  Output>
  00 00 00 14 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 04     <- 4 = gcd(12,8)
  Input>asir quit                         <- execute asir 'quit' command
