Getting the whole source tree by CVSup (written by Ohara)

CVSup is free software and the source code and the binaries can be
obtained from the following URL:

http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/CVSup/

While you can get any specified version of the source with the
usual cvs, you can get only the latest source code by using CVSup.

After installing CVSup, decide a directory for putting OpenXM source
tree and a working directory for CVSup.  Let these directories be
/home/ohara/openxm and /home/ohara/tmp.  You have to create these
directories in advance.  Then create a file 'openxm-supfile'
containing the following lines:

*default host=cvsup.math.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp
*default base=/home/ohara/tmp
*default prefix=/home/ohara/openxm
*default release=cvs tag=.
*default delete use-rel-suffix
*default compress
openxm
openxm-contrib
openxm-contrib2

Then execute cvsup as follows:

% cvsup -g openxm-supfile		

where '-g' option indicates disabling GUI. You will get the whole
source tree in /home/ohara/openxm. Once you have the source tree, you
can update it by executing the same command.
