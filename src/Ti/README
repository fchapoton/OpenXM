TiGRES -- version 0.9 
  A program for enumerating all reduced grobner bases of a toric ideal.

  To build the executable:
		unpack contents and type "make tigers"

  For instructions: type "./tigers -h"

Sub directories
    "examples"  contains example input files.
       "paper"  contains a latex version of the paper

BUGS/Things which should be fixed soon.
A) TIMING DOESN'T WORK RIGHT FOR LARGE EXAMPLES
a) Add an option for computing the universal grobner basis.
b) Use more efficient way of storing list of grobner bases and
   checking to see if a new one has allready been seen in the
   exsearch.c.
