README (Updated: 1998/11/21)

"Kan/sm1" is a system for doing algebraic analysis by computer based on 
computations of Groebner bases.
It is also useful to teach basic notions such as stack, reccursive call,
object oriented naming system.
This material may be freely distributed as is.
This distribution contains only a few examples in the Doc directory.

Directories
-----------

Kan      Source files of the kan-library and kan-virtual-machine (kan/sm1).
gc       Garbage collector written by Hans-J. Boehm and Alan J. Demers.
         See the README of this directory for the details.
         In order to get the newest version of it, ftp from
                 beta.zerox.com
gmp      GNU MP package
Doc      Documents. Type in "make" to get the document ttt.tex, onlinehelp.tex.
         "ttt.tex" is generated from ex.tex. 
         "onlinehelp.tex" will be generated from the running version of sm1.
         ttt.tex : introduction, onlinehelp.tex : macro reference manual.
         Library files.
         This directory contains many libraries with an easy user interface
         written by sm1.
         To load all libraries, type in  (cohom.sm1) run  in sm1.
         See Section 3 of onlinehelp.tex for details.
lib      symbolic link to Doc.
bibreference.tex :  A sample citation of kan/sm1.
plugin           :  plugin modules for sm1. Open XM support.
Makefile         :  makefile

 
Installation
------------

<<1>>
The kan/sm1-system is mainly developed and tested 
on the Linux operating system with the elf-kernel version 1.2.13.
The system will be run on the machines with ansi C-compilers 
on which the Garbage collector of Boehm and Demers works.
 If you use the same environment, you need no configuration.
(On some versions of Linux, you must modify Kan/Makefile following
the comment in it.)

Set the load path for library files if necessary. ==> see (B) below.

Then, just type:
% make all

You will have 
   sm1
in the directory Kan.
Move this file to a directory on your search path.
(For example, 
    mv sm1 ~/bin
or
    mv sm1 /usr/local
)

-------------------------------------------------
(A) No plugin
If you do not need plugin modules for socket and so on, then
(1) edit Kan/Makefile and delete all lines begin with PLUGIN.
(2) Type in  "make all2"
--------------------------------------------------
(B) Loading path
Edit the Kan/stackm.h and change the value
       #define LOAD_SM1_PATH "/usr/local/lib/sm1/"
to a directory where you can put all the files *.sm1 in lib directory.
Do not forget to put / at the tail.
If you are allowed to use /usr/local/lib/sm1, then
you do not need to change the value of LOAD_SM1_PATH and type in
    mkdir /usr/local/lib/sm1
    cp lib/*.sm1 /usr/local/lib/sm1
When you try to run a file, the system will try to find it firstly
in the current directory, secondly in the path defined above, and
finally, the path specified by the environmental variable
LOAD_SM1_PATH.
Example:(csh)   setenv LOAD_SM1_PATH $HOME/lib/sm1/
        (bash)  LOAD_SM1_PATH=$HOME/lib/sm1/   ; export LOAD_SM1_PATH

FAQ on the installation -----------------------------------------
Q. My compilation on solaris 2.x stopped with the message
   ./if_mach SPARC SUNOS5 as -o mach_dep.o ./sparc_mach_dep.s
   Couldn't execute: No such file or directory
A. On Solaris 2.x machines,  /usr/ccs/bin must be in your search path.
   If your shell is the C-shell, type in
     set path = ($path /usr/ccs/bin)
     rehash
     make

Q. I cannot compile the source code on Solaris.
A. Before compiling, you need to edit Kan/Makefile and Kan/global.c 
   following comments for Solaris (grep Solaris).

Q. I failed the compilation on Debian GNU/Linux, 2.0.34, gcc 2.7.2.3
A. Compile gc on the redhat linux 4.x (cd gc ; make ) and copy gc/gc.a
   or get the latest version of gc. You may use www.altavisa.com to 
   find a distribution cite of gc4.x.
