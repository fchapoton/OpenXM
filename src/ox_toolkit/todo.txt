* We need a sample program that explains how to construct
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_INT,32))
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_STRING,"Hello"))
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_LIST,1,2,3))
    (OX_COMMAND,(SM_popCMO))
    etc
  by using C functions.

* We also need a sample program that explains how to get
  int, char *, and so on from the received data.

* Sample ox_server:  ox_X.
  It accepts the following commands:
      m setcolor
      x y setpixel
      x y moveto
      x y lineto
      clear
  and draw pixels and lines on a window.
  Reference:  unkei:~taka/this/Joho/glib.c  (How to use -lX11?)

  Sample use of ox_X :  draw a Mandelbrot set.
