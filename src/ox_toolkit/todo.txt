* We need a sample program that explains how to construct
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_INT,32))
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_STRING,"Hello"))
    (OX_DATA,(CMO_LIST,1,2,3))
    (OX_COMMAND,(SM_popCMO))
    etc
  by using C functions.

* We also need a sample program that explains how to get
  int, char *, and so on from the received data.
