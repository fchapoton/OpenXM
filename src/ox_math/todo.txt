* We need examples of client programs which can be used
  in class rooms or in study of mathematics.
  Example 1:
    \beta nbc basis.
    Mathematica --> ox_asir (\beta nbc package)
    Reference : Orlik and Terao, Arrangements of Hyperplanes, Springer.
  Example 2:
    Generate randomly symmetric matrices and
    display the distribution of the maximal eigenvalues.
    asir --> ox_math(EigenValues) and ox_gnuplot
  Example 3:
    Translate the Selberg differential equation to
    a Pfaffian form.
    Mathematica --> ox_sm1.
    asir --> ox_sm1.
    Reference : Aomoto and Kita, Hypergeometric Functions, Appendix.
  Example 4:
    Mathematica Note book that explains what is primary ideal
    decomposition.
    Mathematica --> ox_asir.
  Example 5:
    Taylor expansion.
    asir --> ox_math.

* Find rational solutions of Garnier systems by exhaustive search.
  It is a nice problem of solving algebraic equations.
