$OpenXM$

* We need examples of client programs which can be used
  in class rooms or in study of mathematics.
  Example 1:
    \beta nbc basis.
    Mathematica --> ox_asir (\beta nbc package)
  Example 2:
    Generate randomly symmetric matrices and
    display the distribution of the maximal eigenvalues.
    asir --> ox_math(EigenValues) and ox_gnuplot
  Example 3:
    Translate the Selberg differential equation to
    a Pfaffian form.
    Mathematica --> ox_sm1.
  Example 4:
    Mathematica Note book that explains what is primary ideal
    decomposition.
    Mathematica --> ox_asir.
  Example 5:
    Taylor expansion.
    asir --> ox_math.
  Example 6:
    Find examples from the books of Sejivic, Knuth, Cox-O'Shea-Little.
