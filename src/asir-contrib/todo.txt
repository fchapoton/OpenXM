* Find rational solutions of Garnier systems by exhaustive search.
  It is a nice problem of solving algebraic equations.
  (This project is also mentioned in src/ox_math/todo.txt)

* Introductory tutorial for OpenXM.  It should be understandable
  high school students who learned Basic programming in 
     Sugaku A, B, C.

* Write sample programs of asir for the Noro's lecture note:
     unkei:~noro/papers/niigata.ps.gz
  on computer algebra systems.

* Sample programs of asir for the book
     Mori Masatake, Fortran 77 Suuchi-Keisan Programming, Iwanami.

* Sample programs for asir  

  Example 1:
    Write sample programs that implements algorithms 
    in the following books:
     R.Sedgewick, Algorithms in C.
     Knuth : The Art of Programming, Semi-numerical algorithms.
     Cox-O'Shea-Little :  Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms.
     Hikita Teruo, C de kaku Algorithm,  Science-sha
          Chapter 11, geometry algorithm,
          Chapter 12, Parallel programming and algorithms.

  Example 2:
    Rewrite sample programs in
        Kida, Makino : Ubasic ni yoru Computer Seisuu-ron, Nihon Hyoron-sha
    by asir and OpenXM.
