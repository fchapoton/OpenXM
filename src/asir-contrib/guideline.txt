How to commit your asir program to asir-contrib?  [1999, 12/23]

   1.  The function names and global variables 
       should start with  xyz_  or Xyz_ where xyz is
       the name of your package.
       For example, all functions in the package "sm1" start with
       sm1_, e.g., there are functions sm1_gb, sm1_hilbert, and so on
       in the package "sm1".
       Your asir source should be at asir-contrib/packages/src.
    
   2.  Manuals should be written by the texinfo in English.
       They are put in asir-contrib/packagers/doc
       and are included from asir-contrib/packagers/doc/cman-eg.texi.
       Japanese committers are expected to write Japanese manuals, too.
       Japanese manuals are included from 
       asir-contrib/packagers/doc/cman.texi.
       As to styles of manuals, see files in asir-contrib/packages/doc. 

    3. If you want to embed your manual in the source, you are welcome
       to use "oxweave".
