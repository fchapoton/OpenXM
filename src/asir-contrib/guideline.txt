How to commit your asir program to asir-contrib?  [1999, 12/23]

   1.  The function names and global variables 
       should start with  xyz_  or Xyz_ where xyz is
       the name of your package.
       For example, all functions in the package "sm1" start with
       sm1_, e.g., there are functions sm1_gb, sm1_hilbert, and so on
       in the package "sm1".
       Your asir source should be at asir-contrib/packages/src.
    
   2.  Manuals should be written by the texinfo in English.
       They are put in asir-contrib/packagers/doc
       and are included from asir-contrib/packagers/doc/cman-eg.texi.
       Japanese committers are expected to write Japanese manuals, too.
       Japanese manuals are included from 
       asir-contrib/packagers/doc/cman.texi.
       As to styles of manuals, see files in asir-contrib/packages/doc. 

    3. If you want to embed your manual in the source, you are welcome
       to use "oxweave".

    4. Please refer to papers that explain algorithms in your package
       from your texinfo manual.
       Papers are welcome to be included in this asir-contrib package.
       Put them under asir-contrib/packages/doc directory.
       

    5. Please compare your implementation with other implementations.       

    6. Please include test data that you used to check the correctness
       of your implementation.
