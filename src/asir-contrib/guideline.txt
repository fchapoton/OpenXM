How to commit your asir program to asir-contrib? [2005, 3/24]

   1.  The name of your source code should be 
            yourname_xyz.rr
       The part "yourname" may be your nickname. 
       Example:  noro_matrix.rr

       Your asir source should be at asir-contrib/packages/src.
       You may make a new directory under asir-contrib/packages/src
       to put your programs and data,
       but the top level file must be under asir-contrib/packages/src.

   2.  Please encapsulate your source code
       If you want to use the module name which represents a mathematical notion
       or a data structure,
       the module name should be 
           pxxxx
       where "p" is your identifying prefix and xxxx is a name of mathematical
       notion or data structure name related to your module.
       Example: nmatrix  where "p" is "n" and "xxxx" is "matrix".
       Example: fres  where "p" is "f" and "xxxx" is "res" (or "resultant").

    
   3.  Manuals should be written by the texinfo in English and/or Japanese.
       They are put in asir-contrib/packagers/doc/'yourname_xyz'
       The Makefile asir-contrib/packagers/doc/'yourname_xyz'/Makefile
       is also necessary.
       Example: asir-contrib/packages/doc/todo_parametrize/Makefile

   4. If you want to embed your manual in the source, you are welcome
      to use "oxweave" or "gdoc" (see http://texinfo.org).

   5. Please refer to papers that explain algorithms in your package
      from your texinfo manual.

   6. Please include test data that you used to check the correctness
      of your implementation.
