How to commit your asir program to asir-contrib? [2005, 3/24]

   1.  The name of your source code should be 
            yourname_xyz.rr
       The part "yourname" may be your nickname. 
       Example:  noro_matrix.rr

       Your asir source should be at asir-contrib/packages/src.
       Or, you may make a new directory under asir-contrib/packages/src
       to put your programs and data.
       Example: asir-contrib/packages/src/todo_parametrize

       Your may use both your own directory and the top level source code.
       Example:  asir-contrib/packages/src/naka_mora
                 asir-contrib/packages/src/naka_mora.rr

   2.  Please encapsulate your source code with module.
       When you use the module name which represents a mathematical notion
       or a data structure,
       the module name should be 
           pxxxx
       where "p" is your identifying prefix and xxxx is a name of mathematical
       notion or data structure name related to your module.
       Example: nmatrix  where "p" is "n" and "xxxx" is "matrix".
       Example: fres  where "p" is "f" and "xxxx" is "res" (or "resultant").
       Example: nmora  where "p" is "n" and "xxxx" is "mora".

    
   3.  Manuals should be written by the texinfo in English and/or Japanese.
       They are put under the directory 
       asir-contrib/packagers/doc/'yourname_xyz'
       The Makefile asir-contrib/packagers/doc/'yourname_xyz'/Makefile
       is also necessary.
       Example: asir-contrib/packages/doc/todo_parametrize/Makefile
          asir-contrib/packages/doc/todo_parametrize/todo_parametrize_ja.texi

   4. If you want to embed your manual in the source, you are welcome
      to use "oxweave" or "gdoc" (see http://texinfo.org).

   5. Please refer to papers that explain algorithms in your package
      from your texinfo manual.

   6. Please include test data that you used to check the correctness
      of your implementation or to make demonstrations.
