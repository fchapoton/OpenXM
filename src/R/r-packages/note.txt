* C source codes.
 C sources and headers should be developed and edited in the directory
 OpenXM/src/hgm in order to provide a standalone mode without R
 in the OpenXM project.
 They are copied by rsync to hgm/src from OpenXM/src/hgm/
 See the Makefile.

* How to develope and tests.
(1) Develope the system in OpenXM/src/hgm as a standalone system.
    See OpenXM/src/hgm/so3 as an example.
(2) Add rsync-[projectname] to OpenXM/src/R/r-packages/Makefile
    See the example of the project so3.
(3) Example in the case of hgm.
    R CMD check hgm
        It generates pdf documents and shared libraries.
        hgm.Rcheck/hgm-Ex.Rout contains the result of the execution of examples
        embedded in the documents in man.
        hgm.Rcheck/hgm-manual.pdf is the PDF manual.

    R --help

* Notes.
    library.dynam()   shows a list of shared libraries loaded.
    dyn.load("hgm.so") can be used to load shared library by hand.
    getwd() gets the current working directory.
