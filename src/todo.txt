SHORT TERM

* Starting our web cite
     www.mathprog.org or www.openxm.org

* PHC pack for free BSD. (Install Ada compiler and try to generate binary).
     Reference: www.mth.msu.edu/~jan

* A unified environment to solve systems of algebraic equations.

* Decompose the install target to
  install-bin
  install-lib
  install-doc
  install-man  


OpenXM PROTOCOL ITSELF

* Notify the error "ox server ox_hogehoge does not exists."

* Restarting server
  (ox_sm1 does not restore the stack after the error.)

* Make the control process as an ox stackmachine.

* Support of tree structures?  How?

* Starting the remote session by ssh (Tamura and Ohara)

* Security level (cf. sm1 [(SecureMode) 1] system_variable)

* SPEED UP!

OX SERVERS:

* ox_porta  (Polytopes) 
     Reference: ftp.elib.zib-berline.de/pub/mathprog
     Computational Geometry.

* ox_sound
     OX server for mathematically synthesized music.
     For example, I want to hear the sound of (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)*sin(x).

* ox_ray_tracer
     It outputs a high quality graphics.
     Can you draw a high-quality graph of z=x^2-y^2?
     Can you draw a high-quality graph of z=1/(x^2+y^2)?
     Can you draw a zero set of x^3-y^2 z^2?
     Can we utilize povray, gimp, ...?
     Many many examples of minimal surfaces.
     Scientific visualization.
     Data format for mathematical graphical data.
     Do we have new problems in 3-dim graphics for Mathematical presentations?
     Generation of video like "turning the sphare inside out"

* ox_turtle
     turtle graphics server.
     Graphics of Cell Automaton.  See the book by Miyachi.

* ox_m2  ox_gap
     Macaulay 2, GAP, opal, etc, etc, ...
     www.matx.org (A free soft like MatLab)
     New CMO should be defined. 


INTERFACE

* What is the best language for our project
  in view of mathematics and distributed computation?
 
* A nice help system.  Learning mathematics via the help system.

* KLIC interface for OpenXM.

* (Nara) Standard Lisp interface for OpenXM.

* MCP on OpenXM  (Web interface and protocols --- by B.Char
                  See http://snake.mcs.kent.edu.)
  Middle regulator ... on OpenXM  (Deguchi project)
  Web frontend for OpenXM servers.  w3c.
  Exposition of math programs on web ( asir-contrib/packages/src/dsolv)
  See also  "Algebra, Interactive" (a book by A.Cohen).

* Web cite that keeps math data.  How to organize data?
