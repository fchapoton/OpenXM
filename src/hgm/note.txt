* Naming of C functions.
   C functions in this folder may also be used in r-packages.
   They are loaded dynamically from shared libraries.
   Then, it is recommended to use the following naming conventions
   to define C functions.
   When the directory name is xxyy, all (non-static) functions should have
   a name starting with xxyy_ and global variables a anme starting with
   XXYY_.
   For example, all function names in so3 start with so3_ and
   all global variables in so3 start with SO3_.  See the directory so3/src.

* The main() functions for the standalon mode should be enclosed as
  #ifdef STANDALONE  ~~~ main ~~~~  #else  ~~~~~ #endif
  In order to generate R-shared libraries, the main function should not
  be included.
  See the file so3/src/so3_nc.c as an example.

* A subset of gsl should be put under gsl-t-[numbers].
  The subset is necessary to generate a shared library for R.
  The R project does not recommend to include the full set of GSL.
  Please use #ifdef USE_GSL_LIB ~~~~ #else ~~~~ #endif.
  See so3/src/so3_nc.c and so3/src/Makefile as an example.
