The cfep/asir in this distribution works only on Intel Mac's.
(It does not run on old PPC Mac's.)

Install:
1.  Install "xcode" from MacOS install disk.  It is under the optional tools.

The procedure is explained, for example (2010.06.09), in     
http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_to_install_apple_developer_tools_cc_gcc_mac_os_x.html

If you do not install it, you will get the error 
"cpp is not found. End of file is detected" when you load packages in cfep/asir.

2.  Drag and drop "cfep" at any place you want. Then, the installation is done.


Uninstall:
Move cfep to the trash.
