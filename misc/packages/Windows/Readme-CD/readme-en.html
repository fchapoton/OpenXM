<h1> How to use <font color="green"> OpenXM/Risa/Asir for Windows </font> <br>
(a distributed system for computational mathematics)? </h1>

<font color="red">
<h2> System requirements</h2>
</font>

The system
<a href="http://www.openxm.org"> OpenXM</a>/Risa/Asir for Windows
works on Windows 2000/XP.
It is <font color="green"> a developing version </font> and
supports only <font color="green"> a subset </font> of the OpenXM package.
The full support is available only on the unix version of
OpenXM/Risa/Asir.

OpenXM/Risa/Asir also works on Windows 98/ME, but 
it is slow because the communication speed among OpenXM components
through TCP/IP 
is very slow on Windows 98/ME.
