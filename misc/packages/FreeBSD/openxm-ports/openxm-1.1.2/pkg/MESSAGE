[1] The binary /usr/local/OpenXM/bin/asir requires a key.
You need a key for each machine on which you want to run Asir.
In order to get the key, send an e-mail consisting of

ASIR XXXXXXXXX

to risa@sec.flab.fujitsu.co.jp.
ASIR XXXXXXXXX is the output that you will get when you run
asir without the key.

After a while, an e-mail will be returned containing only one line like

YYYYYYYY YYYYYYYY YYYYYYYY

Create '/usr/local/OpenXM/lib/asir/asir_key'
if necessary and append the returned string to the file.

[2] 
   /usr/local/jdk1.1.8/bin/java should be used.
   Set the directory /usr/local/jdk1.1.8/bin before /usr/local/bin
   in your search path.
   Example (for csh):
     set path=(/usr/local/jdk1.1.8/bin $path) 
     rehash

[3] Linux emulation should be used if you want to run the PHC pack.
   Add the following line to your /etc/rc.conf
    linux_enable="YES"
   if you do not have.
