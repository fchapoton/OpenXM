#
# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that make up
# the OpenXM source tree.
#
# CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest CVS
# tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your system easily
# and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed
# at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows
# to keep your CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup openxm-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 openxm-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=cvsup.math.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp
#	This specifies the server host which will supply the file
#	updates. You can override this setting on the command line
#	with cvsup's "-h host" option.
#
# base=/usr
#	This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#	about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#	A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#	/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#	collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#	~1MB of data in this directory.  You can override the
#	"base" setting on the command line with cvsup's "-b base"
#	option.  This directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/usr
#	This specifies where to place the requested files. A setting of
#	"/usr" will place all of the files requested in "/usr/src"
#	(e.g., "/usr/OpenXM", "/usr/OpenXM_contrib").
#	The prefix directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
